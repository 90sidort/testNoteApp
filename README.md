# testNoteApp
This is a notes app for auto tests demonstration purposes. This repo contains simple Notes App based on The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp by Andrew Mead and testCafe tests that I have created for it.

To run:

    Download or clone repository
    Run Git Bash in todo-app folder
    Type "npm install" in Git Bash
    Type "npm run dev-server" in Git Bash
    Type "npm run test" in new Git Bash instance (in todo-app folder as well). OR
    Type "npx testcafe chrome testing/tests/*.spec.js" to run tests in Testcafe runner

List of my features:

    create notes categories
    add notes counter
    add info if no notes in category
    delete all notes
    [WIP] weather information displayed (to requests mocking)

Application was created for demonstration purposes only so please do not judge the code. Same goes for testCafe tests- they are not the optimal version- just to demonstrate different ways in which testCafe can help automated testing.
